# BuccConnect

The largest project I'm working on. It is designed to connect other tech professionals to eachother. The idea came from
my job search and wanting to constantly practice. Not the most original idea, however it really helped me learn how
data moves from the backend to frontend.

The backend API was designed using Express with a MongoDB. This was my first experience using JavaScript on the backend, 
as well as using a NoSQL database. The front end using React and Redux to create a dynamic user experience. 
It's still in the early stages of functionality, as I am working on creating a uniform design for the PWA. Basic 
functionality is there, however components still need to be further decoupled and reorganized.
